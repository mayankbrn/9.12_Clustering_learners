# Clustering for learners

## Unsupervised Learning - Clustering 📊

Welcome to the project! 🎉 

## About Company
We have data for one of EdTech companies which is an online tech-versity offering intensive computer science & Data Science courses through live classes delivered by tech leaders and subject matter experts. The meticulously structured program enhances the skills of software professionals by offering a modern curriculum with exposure to the latest technologies. 


## Business Problem 📈
You are working as a data scientist with the analytics vertical of the company, focused on profiling the best companies and job positions to work for from its database. You are provided with the information for a segment of learners and tasked to cluster them on the basis of their job profile, company, and other features. Ideally, these clusters should have similar characteristics.

## Dataset/ Column Profiling:📋

The dataset at the heart of this exploration. Here are some of the key features:

## Data Dictionary

| Column Name        | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| `Unnamed 0`       | Index of the dataset |
| `Email_hash`      | Anonymized Personal Identifiable Information (PII) |
| `Company_hash`    | Anonymized identifier for the company (current employer of the learner) |
| `orgyear`        | Employment start date |
| `CTC`            | Current CTC (Cost to Company) |
| `Job_position`   | Job profile in the company |
| `CTC_updated_year` | Year in which CTC got updated (Yearly increments, Promotions) |

## Concepts Used

- **Manual Clustering**
- **Unsupervised Clustering**
  - K-Means Clustering
  - Hierarchical Clustering
